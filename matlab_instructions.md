# Introduction
Hello! Thank you for being one of the first users of the new matlab implementation in the Lobot cluster. This is our first time setting up matlab capabilities in the cluster, so there are bound to be some teething issues. Please send an email to <a href="help@cs.queensu.ca">help@cs.queensu.ca<a>

NOTE: We have not installed any additional toolsets, which I'm sure you will need. 

# Some basic instructions:

If your resources are allowed to use matlab, you will have the option to select an image that contains matlab. See the two images available

You can access matlab multiple ways, depending on your needs.

The first time you ever run matlab, the license screen will come up. Choose existing license. This will use the Queen's Networking Matlab license.

The first time you start matlab, it will take a bit to load behind the scenes, but then it should be good to go. Here's running a command in a jupyter notebook.
